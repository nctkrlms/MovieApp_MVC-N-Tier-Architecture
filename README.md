[Coding and Architecture]
I used the N-Tier Architecture for coding, which consists of four layers: presentation, data access, business, and entity layers. I employed a code-first approach for ORM and used the .NET Framework for it.

[Database and Tables]
I utilized a local SQL Server for data tables and created the tables in C# using the Entity Framework ORM.
